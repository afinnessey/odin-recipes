        <li> In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>  Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>

        <li>  Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. </li>
        <li>  Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through. </li>
        <li>  Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>  Set aside.</li>
        <li>  In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. </li>
        <li> Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.</li>
